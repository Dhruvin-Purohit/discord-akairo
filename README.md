TL;DR, I needed to add some of the new Discord features but I didn't want to wait

***REQUIREMENTS***:

```md
#### discord.js master `yarn add discordjs/discord.js` or `npm i discordjs/discord.js`

#### Intents

#### discord-akairo (obv this repo) `yarn add ya-sach1/discord-akairo` or `npm i ya-sach1/discord-akairo`

#### Latest stable node version
```
